# Explainability

Explainability is a core invariant of Issue Assistant.

Every recommendation, classification, and score is derived from deterministic rules
with concrete evidence.

Per-issue explainability JSON files are the ground truth for why a specific outcome occurred.

This document serves as a global index of rule families used during analysis.
